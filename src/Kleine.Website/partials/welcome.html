            <p>Family members and friends of {{ $state.client.CouplesNames }} will make their best prediction about the birth of {{ $state.client.BabyAlias }}. There are five categories to make predictions about:</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gender</li>

                    <li>Time</li>
                    <li>Weight</li>
                    <li>Length</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Each prediction category is worth a certain amount of points. Once {{ $state.client.BabyAlias }} is born the two people with the most points will earn a <a ui-sref="reward">reward</a>.</p>
